Our main objective is to develop a 
multifunction calculator using python. These 
four-functions are addition, subtraction, 
multiplication and division. However, we will 
also have some extra functions so that we 
could give our calculator a more scientific 
feature to make our project a little challenging 
and have a good outcome. For this, here we 
will also calculate sort, root, square root, 
power functions (individually having square 
and cubic power button for ease), logarithm 
(log10), natural logarithm (ln), exponential 
value (e), factorial, degree, radian, percentage, 
trigonometric functions(sin, cos, tan), pie 
value calculations, number system 
converter(Binary, Decimal, Octal, Hexa) etc.
